- 👋 Hi, I’m @JezzahC
- 👀 I’m interested in maths, physics, computer science - the whole shabang
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an "advanced" note app (basically all that one would need in a maths lecture in one app)
- 💞️ I'm not really looking for collaborations at this point; I am trying to expand my own repositories first XD
- 😄 Pronouns: he / him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I *love* to watch those lectures that are filmed online from a bunch of different universities. They're so fun!
